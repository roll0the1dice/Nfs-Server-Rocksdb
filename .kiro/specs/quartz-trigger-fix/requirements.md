# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical ClassCastException in the LifecycleService where a SimpleTriggerImpl cannot be cast to CronTrigger. The error occurs in the modifyJobTime method at line 179, which is called during lifecycle startup. This fix will implement proper trigger type handling to prevent runtime casting exceptions and ensure reliable job scheduling functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the lifecycle service to start without ClassCastException errors, so that the application can initialize properly and handle scheduled jobs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LifecycleService.start() method is called THEN the system SHALL NOT throw ClassCastException during trigger type handling
2. WHEN modifyJobTime() is invoked THEN the system SHALL properly identify trigger types before casting
3. WHEN a SimpleTrigger is encountered THEN the system SHALL handle it appropriately without attempting to cast to CronTrigger
4. WHEN a CronTrigger is encountered THEN the system SHALL process it using CronTrigger-specific methods

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper trigger type detection and handling, so that different trigger types can coexist in the same scheduler without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters any Trigger type THEN it SHALL use instanceof checks before casting
2. WHEN processing SimpleTrigger instances THEN the system SHALL use SimpleTrigger-specific methods and properties
3. WHEN processing CronTrigger instances THEN the system SHALL use CronTrigger-specific methods and properties
4. IF an unsupported trigger type is encountered THEN the system SHALL log an appropriate warning and handle gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for trigger operations, so that I can diagnose and resolve scheduling issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trigger type mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including trigger type and expected type
2. WHEN trigger operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages with context
3. WHEN the system recovers from trigger errors THEN it SHALL log the recovery action taken
4. IF trigger operations cannot be completed THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully without crashing the entire lifecycle service
